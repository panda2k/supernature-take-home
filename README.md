[Vite](https://vitejs.dev), and [Vuex](https://vuex.vuejs.org/) for the frontend.

## Functionality
This site reads an Itinerary excel sheet and displays it. You can also download
the current sheet with the download sheet button.


If you login (Google OAuth), the file will be uploaded to the cloud and retrievable
with the past uploads button. From the past uploads button, you can delete,
display, or download old sheets.
